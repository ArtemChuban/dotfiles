# Dot Files

I'm using:

- **zsh** as shell
  - **oh-my-zsh** for configuration
    - [**common**](https://github.com/jackharrisonsherlock/common) as theme
    - Plugins
      - [**zsh-syntax-highlighting**](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting)
      - [**zsh-autosuggestions**](https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions)
- [**zoxide**](https://github.com/ajeetdsouza/zoxide) for faster `cd`
- [**zellij**](https://zellij.dev) as terminal multiplexer
- **helix** as text editor
- **lazygit** as terminal UI for git
- **dprint** as markdown formatter
- **exa** instead of `ls`
